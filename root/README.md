# Account File
Account filing connects the bots with certain names that aren't set in General tab. It can be useful if you want to bot a server with NameMC names, for example. To make a account file, you would need to go into a text file editor, and apon entering all the usernames, you save it as a `.txt` file. You can name it anything. **Please note that you can set Max Accounts in General Tab or it will use all the names**
## What an account file would look like
```
vampers
nVoid
Danilo764
```
# Proxies
Proxy file must be a ` .txt ` file. And it's used in Random order
Proxies connects the bots with different ip addresses. This can be very useful to bypass the max connections to a server, or bypass the max registerations if it's a cracked server. To make a proxy file, you would need to go into a text file editor, and apon entering all the proxies with ports, you save it as a `.txt` file. You can name it anything. **Please note that you will need to set the SOCKS protocol in Settings Tab for the bots to join!**
## What a proxy file would look like
```
12.34.56.78:9876
54.3.210.123:45678
98.7.65.4:32101
```
# Theme
Custom CSS allows you to customize TrafficerMC the way you wanted. To make a custom css file, you would need to go into a text file editor, and apon finishing the css file, you save it as a `.css` file. You can name it anything. After all that, the file must be loaded in Settings tab. 
## What the css file should look like
```
:root {
    --background-image: url('../icons/app/Background.svg');
    --bg-color: #0c0d11;
    --text-color: #f6f5f5;
    --button-color: #5b8191;
    --button-text-color: #f6f5f5;
    --button-opacity: 1;
    --button-border-color: #454864;;
    --ul-bg-color: #171a25;
    --ul-opacity: 0.7;
    --downbar-color: #3D75C9;
    --selected-item-color: #00e1ff88;
    --selected-item-opacity: 1;
    --downbar-opacity: 1;
    --sidebar-color: 0 0 0;
    --sidebar-opacity: 0.2;
    --topbar-color: 0 0 0;
    --topbar-opacity: 0.6;
}
```
# Name generator
Name generation randomizes the bot's name without any user input. There are 2 current options, which are `(SALT)` and `(LEGIT)`. These must be input in the Username bit in General tab.
## What name generation would look like
```
TrafficerMC_(SALT) = TrafficerMC_hlpC / TrafficerMC_ggKt
(LEGIT) = JogBeeRibTap / GitFunWitSinWar
```
# Building TrafficerMC
If you want to run TrafficerMC in an IDE environment, you can do so. You would need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed before continuing. After node.js is installed, you need to make a folder to put all TrafficerMC code in, and open up a terminal or powershell in that folder. Once you have a terminal opened and on the folder, you need to execute these 3 commands:

 1. `git clone https://github.com/RattlesHyper/TrafficerMC`
 2. `npm install`
 3. `npm start`

If you want to build TrafficerMC, then run `npm run <option>`. The build will be put into /dist folder.
If you want to run TrafficerMC on different OSes, you can do so by doing `npm start <os>`. The current OSes supported are Windows 64-Bit (`winx64`), Windows 32-Bit (`winx86`), Linux 64-Bit (`linux64`) & Linux 32-Bit (`linux86`)
